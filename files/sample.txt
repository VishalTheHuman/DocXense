Within the Mahabharata, the concepts of Samanya Dharma and Vishesha Dharma hold significant sway, molding the ethical structure of society and directing the behaviours of its characters. These dual facets of Dharma furnish a structure for comprehending the overarching principles of virtue alongside the particular duties and obligations allotted to individuals according to their societal positions and situations.
4.1	SAMANYA DHARMA:

Samanya Dharma pertains to the universal standards of righteousness and moral obligation applicable to all individuals, irrespective of their societal standing, profession, or situations. It encompasses qualities like honesty, compassion, integrity, and reverence for life, serving as the cornerstone of ethical conduct within society.

In the Mahabharata, characters are expected to adhere to Samanya Dharma as the fundamental basis of their moral and ethical behaviour. Despite their distinct roles or allegiances, they are bound by a shared set of moral values governing their choices and actions. For instance, the principle of honesty mandates individuals to speak truthfully and maintain integrity in their interactions, while the virtue of compassion encourages them to demonstrate empathy and benevolence towards all beings.

Throughout the epic, characters undergo trials testing their commitment to Samanya Dharma, confronting moral quandaries and ethical dilemmas that challenge their principles and beliefs. Those who uphold these universal standards are lauded as exemplars of righteousness, whereas those who stray from them face the repercussions of their deeds.
4.2	VISHESHA DHARMA:

On the flip side, Vishesha Dharma deals with the particular duties and obligations designated to individuals according to their societal positions, relationships, and commitments. These responsibilities vary depending on one's caste, familial connections, and life circumstances, showcasing the diverse and intricate nature of human society.

In the Mahabharata, characters are bound by their Vishesha Dharma, which dictates their behaviours and responsibilities within the framework of their social roles and affiliations. For instance, as Kshatriyas (warriors), both the Pandavas and Kauravas are mandated to uphold values of courage, integrity, and allegiance to their realm and kin. Similarly, as Brahmins (priests), figures like Drona and Bhishma are expected to embody traits of wisdom, devotion, and altruism in their roles as educators and protectors of righteousness.

While Vishesha Dharma is influenced by societal norms and conventions, it also considers the individual's unique circumstances and challenges. Characters in the Mahabharata frequently find themselves torn between conflicting duties and commitments, grappling to reconcile their personal aspirations with their societal obligations.

In summary, the concepts of Samanya Dharma and Vishesha Dharma offer a comprehensive framework for comprehending the moral and ethical principles governing human behaviour in the Mahabharata. While Samanya Dharma encompasses the universal standards of righteousness applicable to all, Vishesha Dharma delineates the specific duties and responsibilities assigned to individuals based on their societal roles and situations. Together, these two dimensions of Dharma shape the moral terrain of the epic, guiding its characters through the intricacies of duty, integrity, and moral accountability.
