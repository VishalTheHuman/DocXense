The passing of Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and Duryodhana stands as pivotal junctures in the Mahabharata, vividly depicting the complexities of Dharma and its practical implementation. While these deaths might seem to be veiled in adharma initially, a closer examination reveals their alignment with the principles of Dharma, showcasing the nuanced interplay among duty, loyalty, and individual integrity.
2.1	BHISHMA:

Bhishma, the esteemed patriarch of the Kuru lineage, meets his demise on a bed of arrows amidst the tumult of the Kurukshetra conflict. While his passing may initially seem tainted by deceit and betrayal, it ultimately represents the culmination of his steadfast commitment to his dharma as a warrior, guardian of the realm, and keeper of his promises. Bound by his lifelong vow of celibacy and unwavering loyalty to the throne of Hastinapur, Bhishma finds himself compelled to tread the path of duty, even when it requires him to confront those he holds dear. Despite his deep affection for the Pandavas, Bhishma remains true to his allegiance to King Duryodhana, thereby epitomizing the essence of his warrior ethos and his role as a custodian of the kingdom.
2.2	DRONA:

Drona, the esteemed guru of both the Kaurava and Pandava princes, meets his end amidst contentious circumstances on the battlefield. Despite his unmatched skills as a warrior and educator, Drona's steadfast devotion to his duties as a Kshatriya ultimately leads to his downfall. His moral quandary stems from the conflict between his friendship and allegiance to Duryodhana and his responsibilities as a teacher and guardian of righteousness. In the end, Drona's unwavering support for Duryodhana during the war, despite recognizing the righteousness of the Pandavas' cause, seals his fate. His demise sheds light on the intricacies of balancing personal loyalties with broader moral imperatives, emphasizing the complexities inherent in individual dharma.


2.3	KARNA:

Karna, the tragic figure of the Mahabharata, meets his demise on the battlefield at the hands of his half-brother, Arjuna. Despite siding with adharma due to his unyielding loyalty to Duryodhana, Karna embodies virtues of fidelity, magnanimity, and bravery throughout his life. His steadfast allegiance to his friendship with Duryodhana and his adherence to his pledges, even in the face of adversity, demonstrate his commitment to his dharma as a warrior and companion. Nonetheless, Karna's demise also underscores the repercussions of aligning oneself with adharma, as his loyalty to Duryodhana ultimately leads to his downfall.
2.4	DURYODHANA:

Duryodhana, the primary antagonist of the epic, meets his demise in a final clash with Bhima, one of the Pandava siblings. His life is marked by hubris, deceit, and an unyielding quest for dominance. Despite facing defeat and imminent death, Duryodhana remains resolute in his convictions, refusing to compromise his principles until his last breath. His refusal to yield or acknowledge defeat, despite recognizing the righteousness of the Pandavas' cause, demonstrates his unwavering dedication to his dharma as a warrior and leader. However, Duryodhana's demise also serves as a cautionary narrative, highlighting the consequences of arrogance and moral blindness.
